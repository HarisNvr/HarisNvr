## About me

Oh, hello there, traveler! Come and sit with me. Whatâ€™s your name, you said? Nice to meet you! My name is **Kharalampiy**, but you can call me **Kharo**. By the way, I'm Greek, so don't be surprised by the full name.

Let me tell you how I became a programmer. I was drawn to Python because of its simple syntax, extensive community, and numerous open-source resources. My critical thinking has greatly helped me in learning Python, and my desire to test everything "in practice" constantly pushes me towards mastering new technologies. My goal is to gain new knowledge and experience to grow as a developer, network with other professionals, and participate in large projects.

Currently, I am focusing on mastering new techniques in SQL, algorithms, and asynchronous programming.

In addition to programming, I am interested in tabletop and computer games, as well as 3D printing with my own SLA printer. In my free time, I maintain and upgrade my PC, and I am a fan of fantasy and D&D.
